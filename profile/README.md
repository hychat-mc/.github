# The Death of Hychat

It wasn't alive in the first place! If you don't care about the reasons, the upgrade you are looking for is MiscGuild's bridge bot, which is a fork of where Hychat was standing. Please see more here: https://github.com/MiscGuild/bridge

The story: Basically, we had large ambitions for Hychat. We wanted to see it succeed and grow into a business. It turns out that it is really hard to do that, and very time consuming. Time for me (xMdb) is valuable because I have many, *many* real-life commitments. The others devs also are going through with their own education and life stuff. As a result, we abandoned the project before it really started. 

Please ignore everything below, it's just for archival reasons.

If you supported and were hyped for us, thank you :) Hopefully you can put that energy (and money!) into other open-source projects.

- Matt (xMdb)
